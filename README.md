### adhesive - Conditions for adhesivity

The pair of polymatroids (f,XM) and (g,MY) intersecting at M are *adhesive*
if there is a common extension on XMY in which (XM,MY) is a modular pair.

The problem is to give necessary and / or sufficient conditions on the
intersecting polymatroids to be adhesive. This problem is motivated by the
fact that restrictions of entropic polymatroids (i.e., polymatroids defined
by the entropies of multivariable discrete distributions) are adhesive. Any
nontrivial condition implies a non-Shannon type entropy inequality. 
Actually, all known non-Shannon type entropy inequalities can be obtained
this way.

This repository contains the reports on computations which establish the set of
necessary and sufficient conditions for (f,XM) and (g,MY) be adhesive 
when all sets X, M and Y have two elements.
