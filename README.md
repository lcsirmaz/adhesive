### adhesive - Conditions for adhesivity

The pair of polymatroids (f,XM) and (g,YM) intersecting on M are *adhesive*
if there is a common extension on XMY in which (XM,YM) is a modular pair.

The problem is to give necessary and / or sufficient conditions on the
intersection polymatroids to be adhesive. This problem is motivated by the
fact that restrictions of entropic polymatroids (defined by the entropies of
multivariable discrete distributions) are adhesive. Any nontrivial condition
implies a non-Shannon type entropy inequality. Actually, all known such
inequalities can be obtained that way.
